                <p class="Fade_Up text-justify">
                    I am a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at Khulna University 
                    of Engineering & Technology (KUET), currently building a strong foundation 
                    in algorithms, software engineering, database, machine learning, web development, and system design.
                </p>
                <p class="Fade_Up text-justify">
                    I enjoy working close to the core of systems using C and C++, 
                    while also exploring modern web development with JavaScript, TypeScript, 
                    React.js, Node.js, and Laravel. In parallel, I am developing an interest 
                    in data science and machine learning, using Python to understand and 
                    solve data-driven problems.
                </p>
                <p class="Fade_Up text-justify">
                    What excites me most is designing scalable systems and creating clean, 
                    intuitive user interfaces that solve real-world problems efficiently. 
                    Beyond academics, I regularly work on personal and academic projects and 
                    take part in competitive programming contests, which help sharpen my 
                    logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
                </p>
                <p class="Fade_Up text-justify">
                    I am motivated by continuous learning and enjoy turning ideas 
                    into reliable, well-structured software solutions.
